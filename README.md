**Introduction**

Danny was scrolling through his Instagram feed when something really caught his eye — “80s Retro Styling 🎸 and Pizza 🍕 Is The Future!”

Danny was sold on the idea, but he knew that pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire — so he had one more genius idea to combine with it — he was going to Uberize it — and so Pizza Runner was launched!

Danny started by recruiting “runners” to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny’s house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

**Table Relationship**

> customer_orders — Customers’ pizza orders with 1 row each for individual pizza with topping exclusions and extras, and order time.

> runner_orders — Orders assigned to runners documenting the pickup time, distance and duration from Pizza Runner HQ to customer, and cancellation remark.

> runners — Runner IDs and registration date

> pizza_names — Pizza IDs and name

> pizza_recipes — Pizza IDs and topping names

> pizza_toppings — Topping IDs and name
